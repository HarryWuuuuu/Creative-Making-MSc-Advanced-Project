# Posthuman Archive**
  
# Introduction
Posthuman Archive is a speculative design practice about designing posthuman by human essence. With cataloguing 49 jewelleries in human history, the work explores the nature of human from different culture and society. The designer tries to use neural networks to capture the latent space of human essence in jewellery and combines them with common phrases (prompts) to create a series of posthuman pictures and videos. Essence flowing in these visual archives provide a posthuman context for audience to reflect on what will human be.
