# Posthuman Archive
  
## Introduction
Posthuman Archive is a speculative design practice about designing posthuman by human essence. With cataloguing 49 jewelleries in human history, the work explores the nature of human from different culture and society. The designer tries to use neural networks to capture the latent space of human essence in jewellery and combines them with common phrases (prompts) to create a series of posthuman pictures and videos. Essence flowing in these visual archives provide a posthuman context for audience to reflect on what will human be.

## Research Process
In order to dig the human essence from the object, I took some interviews and asked participants "If you need to choose object(s) to accompany you for the rest of your life, which object(s) will be?" (![The Result of Interviews](https://github.com/HarryWuuuuu/Creative-Making-MSc-Advanced-Project/blob/main/Research%20Process/Interview%20Results.pdf)) Jewellery becomes one of the most popular object.

In that case, I took an ethnographic research about the history of jewellery. During the research, I collected jewellery's birth time, culture, region, images and related comments, and tried to extract the properties and expressions related to human essence. (![The Timeline of Jewellery History](https://github.com/HarryWuuuuu/Creative-Making-MSc-Advanced-Project/blob/main/Research%20Process/Jewellery%20History.pdf)) Based on the images collected in ethnographic research, I tried to use machine learning to describe these jewelleries, and found out what is hidden behind jewellery in a relatively objective way, which can also avoid anthropocentric understanding of jewellery. Then I extracted all nouns from the description by natural language processing and tried to found the relation between each jewelleries. (![Noun Research](https://github.com/HarryWuuuuu/Creative-Making-MSc-Advanced-Project/blob/main/Research%20Process/Noun%20Research.pdf)) 

After that, I found that jewellery indicates the human desire for power. It's also evolving with the development of material and human skills. The form and pattern of jewelleri are also filled with symbolic significance that reflects many cultural presentations and social structures. The human essence manifests itself differently in various cultures and societies.

## Speculative Design
Based on the concept of latent space in machine learning, I tried to extract human essence from jewellery and transfer it to a specific visual effect. I took some experiments with different models, weights, datasets, prompts, etc.
